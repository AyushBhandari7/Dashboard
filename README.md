# Video Game Sales Dashboard 
Overview
As part of my data visualization project, I have created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to analyze video game sales data. This project allows users to explore sales trends across various regions, genres, and time periods.

Project Steps
1. Data Import
The first step involved importing the provided CSV file into Tableau. The dataset contains approximately 70,000 rows and includes 11 fields, such as game rank, platform, year, genre, publisher, and total sales segmented by region (North America, Europe, Japan, and global sales).

2. Creating Parameters and Calculated Fields
To enhance the dashboard's functionality, I created parameters for different sales zones (e.g., Global Sales, North American Sales). Additionally, I implemented a calculated field to allow users to filter sales data dynamically based on their selections.

3. Data Visualization
I began constructing visualizations to represent total sales by year. Rather than creating separate worksheets for each region, I utilized the parameter to filter data, providing a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.

4. Adding Interactive Elements
To make the dashboard interactive, I incorporated filters for genres and sales periods. This feature enables users to compare sales performance over different timeframes easily. I also created parameters for start and end dates, allowing for customized data exploration.

5. Developing Additional Visualizations
In addition to the primary sales visualization, I generated several other graphs to display the top-selling games, platforms, and publishers. I employed various visualization techniques, such as tree maps and bubble charts, to create an engaging and informative dashboard.

6. Finalizing the Dashboard
All visualizations were compiled into a cohesive dashboard layout. I ensured that all interactive elements were functioning correctly, allowing users to explore the data intuitively and effectively.

7. Exporting and Sharing
Finally, I exported the dashboard as an image and documented my process in this repository. This project showcases the capabilities of Tableau for data visualization and interactive analysis.

Conclusion
This interactive video game sales dashboard provides valuable insights into market trends and sales performance. I hope that this project demonstrates my understanding of data visualization principles and the effective use of Tableau. I look forward to receiving your feedback!
